					<h1>Nap Time</h1>
					<p>Olivia usually naps once a day, about 3-4 hours after waking up. </p>
					<p>We aim for wake up between 8-9am making nap time start between 11-1. </p>
					<p> <sup>I will let you know when she woke up for the day and when I think naptime will
							happen.</sup> </p>
					<p> Naps can last up to 2+ hours, but <strong>should NOT go past 3:30pm.</strong></p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h1>Bedtime</h1>
					<p>Olivia's bedtime routine should start around 6:45p-7p.</p>
					<p> <sup>Unless she didn't nap, then it could start as early as 6:00p.</sup> </p>
					<p>Start by having her brush teeth,
						you don't need to worry about being thorough she can "brush" by chewing on the tooth brush.
						The tooth paste and tooth brush are in the kids bathroom- on the counter or medicine cabinet
					</p>
					<p>She should have a fresh diaper to sleep in.
						Use diaper cream if she has a diaper rash or is red and starting to get one.</p>
					<p>PJs- in the Olives's closet, inside a bin. She can wear anything you want, just make sure she has
						bottoms on if nothing else-she will take her diaper off.</p>
					<p>We have stopped using a binky. if she asks for one remind her "it was broken and in the trash". She may cry just change the subject to the glowing starts on the ceiling.
						Once you are ready for her to lay down, tuck her in with any of her blankets(she may tell you
						which one), tell her you will read one book- The Going to Bed Book is a hit bedtime book and SHORT.
					</p>

					<h1>Potty Training</h1>
					<p>Olivia is becoming very interested in the bathroom and going potty.</p>
					<p> <sup>We are not currently potty training </sup> </p>
					<p>BEWARE: She may take her diaper off if she does not have pants on, sometimes she will take it off pants or not!</p>
					<p>She is into "wiping" which she will take a wipe and pat her front and back. She also likes to sit on her little potty. While playing she might hold her diaper and say "potty", sometimes "poop". Usually she needs a diaper change following, but sometimes she is just describing waht a daiper is for HA.</p>
