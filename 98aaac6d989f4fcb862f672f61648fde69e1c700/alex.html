					<h1>Things Alex Eats</h1>
<p>Alex has started on baby food. You can feed him jar foods(PANTRY) or baby cereal (PANTRY). </p>
<p>To make baby cereal you will make a bottle (8oz) and mix it with 2-6 tablespoons baby cereal, looking for a running grits consistency.</p>

					<h1>Alex Sleep Time</h1>
					<p>Alex is dropping down to one nap a day, usually he has a morning nap that is about 3 hours and a short nap lasting 20-40 minutes in the afternoon. But sometimes he will be up later and not take the morning nap consolidating into one long nap in the middle of day. </p>
					<p>This means he has some days a longer stretch of awake time, 3-4 hours</p>
					<p> <sup>I will let you know if he is going to have a long stretch with you.</sup> </p>
					<p> Naps can last up to 2+ hours, you don't need to wake him.</p>
                    <p>Fresh diaper and sleepsuit for nap & bedtime. Sometimes he will take a binky, but usually he spits it out.</p>
					<p> <sup>teething gel is by the diapers on the changing table.</sup> </p>

					<h1>Alex Play Time</h1>
                    <p>Alex is actively crawling EVERYWHERE and will stand himself up againslt anything. Please watch where you set him down, he will crawl away!</p>
					<p>Alex likes to "talk" and will coo back and forth with you. If you mimick his noises you can get him to smile or laugh.</p>
					<p>The walker or jumper upstairs are big hits. The tent downstairs is a great containment option for him. Though Olive knows how to undo the zippers.</p>
                    <p>If you want to take him outside in the cooler weather make sure he is bundled- head, hands, & toes! </p>
                    <p>You can find hats, gloves, jackets, shoes, and anything to go out in the front hall closet. </p>

                    <!-- SUMMER DIRECTIONS -->
					<!-- <p>If you want to go outside with him, please sit in the shade or use the pop up tent for shade.</p> -->
